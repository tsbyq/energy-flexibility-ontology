Han,

I like the top 5 KPIs you showed last week. Maybe we can compile a table on KPIs including what data are needed to calculate them, who are stakeholders. What scale (system, building, community) does a particular KPI cover should be included too.

This can be part of the EF ontology which serves to support BEM and data analytics of EF from sensor and meter data.

Han,

To pick up the discussion on EF ontology, we can focus on the definition of EF KPIs and characterization of flexible loads and resources, which facilitates BEM and data-driven methods to quantify, evaluate and benchmark EF.

A few key points:
1. Use BEDES and ASHRAE terminologies, as well as Project Haystack tags
2. Observe W3C ontological best practices
3. Interoperability with BIM/gbXML and EnergyPlus JSON/IDD, district scale GeoJSON/CityGML, Buildingsync, and BRICK schema
4. Keep an eye on: ASHRAE 223P and 229P, IBPSA-USA Building Data Exchange

The idea is to have a small but dedicated EF ontology that can link to existing data tools rather than to have a big one overlapping or conflicting with existing tools.

Once we have a skeleton of the EF ontology, we can discuss it with Amir, Harry, and stakeholders to get feedback.
